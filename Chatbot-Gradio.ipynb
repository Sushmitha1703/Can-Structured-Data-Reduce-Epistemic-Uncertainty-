This is because stress can increase the levels of certain hormones in the body, such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can make us feel more agitated and on edge. Additionally, when we are stressed, our bodies are in a state of heightened arousal, which can make us more sensitive to irritants and triggers that would not normally bother us.
